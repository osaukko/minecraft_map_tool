The `map_0.dat` was generated with `minecraft_map_tool` using the `test_tool` feature. It contains all possible map colors. The `map_0.png` file is a texture image captured from the Minecraft game with the help of the [apitrace](http://apitrace.github.io/).

The Image was optimized with the [OptiPNG](https://optipng.sourceforge.net/) using the following command:

```bash
optipng -o7 -zm1-9 -strip all map_0.png
```

Colors are still the same after optimization.

When `minecraft_map_tool` can render `map_0.dat` with the same colors as in `map_0.png`, it works correctly.
